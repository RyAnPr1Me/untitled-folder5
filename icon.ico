# Since we can't create a proper .ico file here, this is a placeholder
# In a real build environment, you would:
# 1. Create a proper icon using an image editor
# 2. Convert it to .ico format using tools like ImageMagick or online converters
# 3. Place it in the project root

# For Inno Setup, you can use any 32x32 or 16x16 icon file
# This file serves as documentation for the expected icon location
